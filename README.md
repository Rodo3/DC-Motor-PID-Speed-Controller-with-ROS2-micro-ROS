# üöÄ DC Motor PID Speed Controller with ROS2 & micro-ROS

This project presents the **design, simulation, and implementation of a real-time PID controller** for a brushed DC motor using an ESP32 microcontroller running **micro-ROS**, a lightweight ROS 2 client library tailored for resource-constrained embedded systems. The system achieves precise speed control, with a fully reconfigurable control interface through ROS 2 topics, and is validated via both simulations and physical experiments.

## üìå Project Summary
- **Objective:** Precisely control the angular velocity of a DC motor using a PID algorithm and monitor system performance through ROS 2 tools.
- **Platform:** Embedded ESP32 node with micro-ROS communicating over serial with a ROS 2 host system.
- **Control Strategy:** Proportional‚ÄìIntegral‚ÄìDerivative (PID) control with dynamic tuning of Kp, Ki, and Kd.
- **Input Signals:** Step, square, and sine wave reference profiles generated from a separate ROS 2 signal generator node.

## üß† Features
- **Dynamic PID Tuning:** Control gains can be updated in real time via dedicated ROS 2 topics (`/Kp`, `/Ki`, `/Kd`).
- **Fully Decentralized Control:** All core control computations occur on the ESP32, enabling scalable deployment without reliance on high-performance central systems.
- **Encoder-Based Feedback:** Motor speed is calculated from encoder pulses and published on the topic `/motor_output`.
- **Dead-Zone Compensation:** Ensures motor behavior remains stable even in low PWM ranges by adjusting signal thresholds.
- **Anti-Windup Strategy:** Prevents the integral term from growing unbounded when actuators reach saturation.

## üß± System Architecture Overview
### Block Diagram
![Block Diagram](docs/block_diagram.png)

### Key Components
- **ESP32 Node (`motor_node`)**: Reads encoder feedback, performs PID control, generates PWM + direction signals, publishes measured speed.
- **External PC (ROS 2 host)**: Publishes desired setpoint and PID parameters. Also visualizes system data and logs output.
- **ROS 2 Communication:** 
  - Topics: `/set_point`, `/Kp`, `/Ki`, `/Kd`, `/motor_output`
  - Messages: `std_msgs/Float32` and `Float64`

### Control Loop Cycle
1. External ROS 2 node sends:
   - Desired speed reference `/set_point`
   - Control parameters `/Kp`, `/Ki`, `/Kd`
2. ESP32:
   - Reads current velocity via encoder
   - Calculates error `e = set_point - measured_velocity`
   - Computes PID control signal `u(t)`
   - Applies anti-windup and normalizes `u(t)` to [-1, 1]
   - Maps `u(t)` to PWM signal and motor direction (forward/reverse)
   - Publishes updated velocity `/motor_output`

## üõ∞Ô∏è ROS 2 Topics Used
| Topic           | Type       | Description                                               |
|----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `/set_point`   | Float64    | Desired angular velocity in rev/s                        |
| `/Kp` `/Ki` `/Kd` | Float32 | PID controller gains                                     |
| `/motor_output`| Float64    | Actual motor speed measured by encoder                   |

These topics allow **runtime flexibility** and **low-latency control** in embedded robotics applications. The dynamic updates enable iterative PID tuning without reflashing or recompilation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è PID Control Strategy
### PID Algorithm
The ESP32 calculates the control signal every 35 ms using:
```
error = setpoint - measured_velocity
integral += error * dt
integral = clamp(integral, -max_integral, max_integral)
derivative = (error - error_prev) / dt
control_signal = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative
normalized_signal = clamp(control_signal / max_possible_signal, -1, 1)
```

### Sample Time Selection
To ensure proper dynamic response capture, the sampling time was selected using Nyquist‚Äôs criterion and desired resolution:

```
Ts = min(1 / (2 * f_max), œÑ / n)
```
Where:
- `f_max` is the maximum operating frequency of the motor (3 rev/s)
- `œÑ` is the characteristic system response time (‚âà 0.2 s)
- `n` is the number of samples desired per period (e.g., 6 samples)

Thus, `Ts = min(0.167 s, 0.033 s) ‚âà 0.033 s`

This guarantees accurate tracking of reference signals without overloading the MCU.

### Dead-Zone Compensation
Prevents undesired behavior when PWM values are too low for the motor to respond.

### Anti-Windup
Limits the integral term to avoid overshooting when actuator is saturated.
